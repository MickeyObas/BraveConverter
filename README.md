# Welcome to the BraveConvert tool :)

> What is this?

I'm glad you asked. This program receives your csv file which is formatted to store NFT entries and their correct fields- *I hope*- and generates a sha-256 hashed JSON file for every single one of them.

> How do I use it?

1. Fork the repository over or simply clone it into your PC.
2. Place your csv file inside the forked folder.
3. Open the folder on your command terminal or simply change into its directory.
4. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.py` on your command line.
5. Run `braveconvert.py <filename>` on the command line where- `<filename>` is actually your csv file name in quotes and not angle brackets.

I know right, it's THAT easy. Your files have been generated, hashed and properly recomposed into a new csv file.
